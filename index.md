As a recent graduate with a Master's degree in International Business, I am seeking full-time remote employment opportunities in the fields of Business Analysis, Market Research, or Business Strategy. I have extensive knowledge and skills in these areas, including data analysis, market research, strategic planning, and project management. I am passionate about using my expertise to help organizations grow and achieve their goals, and I am excited about the possibility of working remotely to do so.
